### How Do Bot Developers Perceive Bot Development? A Survey
Software bots are becoming more and more popular,  this is due to
the fact that they are a tool that can be used in different contexts.  With this,
software developer has more interest in developing bots, however they may have
to face challenges intrinsic to the development of bot software.  With this, we
seek to understand the profile of bot developers, what motivates them, or what
challenges  they  face  when  dealing  with  bot  development.   To  shed  an  initial
light on this direction,we conducted a survey with 43 Github users who have
been involved (showingtheir interest or actively contributing to) in bot software
projects.
